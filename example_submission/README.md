> This submission is based on the benchmark [blog post](https://www.drivendata.co/blog/genetic-attribution-benchmark/) for the [Genetic Engineering Attribution Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/63/genetic-engineering-attribution/). The goal is to provide an example README that covers all necessary information for a winning submission. Code is provided for reference to help understand the example README.

# Solution - Genetic Engineering Attribution Challenge

Username: kwetstone

## Summary

The solution is a random forest model from the `sklearn` library. The input data is transformed from DNA sequences to counts of four-letter n-grams. To correct for class imbalance in the data, `sklearn`'s built-in class weight setting is used when the random forest is trained. The default criterion, Gini impurity, is used to measure the quality of each split during training. The submission is the raw output of the trained random forest.

# Setup

1. Create an environment using Python 3.8. The solution was originally run on Python 3.8.12. 
```
conda create --name example-submission python=3.8
```

2. Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the data from the competition page into `data/raw`

The structure of the directory before running training or inference should be:
```

├── Makefile           <- Makefile with commands like `make requirements`
└── setup.py           <- makes project pip installable (pip install -e .) so src can be imported
```

# Hardware

The solution was run on macOS Monterey, version 12.1.
- Number of CPUs: 4
- Processor: 2 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5
- Memory: 16 GB 3733 MHz LPDDR4X

Both training and inference were run on CPU.
- Training time: ~2 minutes
- Inference time: ~1.5 minutes

# Run training

To run training from the command line: `python src/run_training.py`

```
$ python src/run_training.py --help
Usage: run_training.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --features-path PATH            Path to the raw training dataset for
                                  processing  [default:
                                  data/raw/train_values.csv]
  --labels-path PATH              Path to the training labels  [default:
                                  data/raw/train_labels.csv]
  --model-save-path PATH          Path to save the trained model weights
                                  [default: models/random_forest.pkl]
  --debug / --no-debug            Run on a small subset of the data for
                                  debugging  [default: no-debug]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

By default, trained model weights will be saved to `models/random_forest.pkl`. The model weights file that is saved out is ~25 MB.

Trained model weights can be downloaded from this Google folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LW3PjXh_rL49VuEwj6oK5PuRM5nD5rPj?usp=sharing

You can use `wget` to download the model weights programmatically:
```
wget --no-check-certificate 'https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1bmE9oVgi58deRdYicfBzNzNButfzjcjs' -O models/random_forest.pkl
```

# Run inference

To run inference from the command line: `python src/run_inference.py`

```
$ python src/run_inference.py --help
Usage: run_inference.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --model-path PATH               Path to the saved model weights  [default:
                                  models/random_forest.pkl]
  --features-path PATH            Path to the test features  [default:
                                  data/raw/test_values.csv]
  --submission-save-path PATH     Path to save the generated submission
                                  [default: data/processed/submission.csv]
  --submission-format-path PATH   Path to the submission format csv  [default:
                                  data/raw/submission_format.csv]
  --debug / --no-debug            Run on a small subset of the data for
                                  debugging  [default: no-debug]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

By default, predictions will be saved out to `data/processed/submission.csv`.
